I came 1st place in Community for this! I livestreamed the whole time, maintained a blog and uploaded a timelapse of the whole thing which can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo0PUvKisjc  

It's been a long time time since this was made and it was made in the 48 hours for the event.  

It uses Processing as it's core and requires some jogl dlls to run:  
* gluegen-rt.dll  
* jogl.dll  
* jogl_awt.dll  
* jogl_cg.dll  

This won't be updated.
